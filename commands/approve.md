description: 'Legacy human design-approval gate (retired in the unified define flow; kept for reference)'
persona: Gatekeeper
status: retired

notes: |
  In the current model, design and tasks are internalised by /h:define and reviewed through
  behaviour playback, and the agent gate is /h:review-pre-verify. This contract documents the
  legacy standalone design gate for projects that still branch design out.

gates:
  - check: 'design.md exists'
    on_fail: STOP, route to /h:design (legacy flow)
  - check: 'design.md "Ref: PENDING"'
    on_fail: STOP, design already approved or rejected

actions:
  - present_design_to_human
  - wait_for_human_response
  - if approved:
    - set_ref: 'APPROVED (in design.md)'
    - prompt_testing_level: ask user to confirm or select the feature's Testing Level (S/M/L) and update design.md header
    - route: to /h:tasks
  - if changes_requested:
    - set_ref: 'REJECTED (in design.md)'
    - route_to_design

must_do:
  - Present full design document
  - Wait for explicit human approval
  - Confirm or select Testing Level (S/M/L) and update design.md header upon approval
  - Update Ref marker in design.md

must_not_do:
  - Approve without human confirmation
  - Proceed without Ref: APPROVED
