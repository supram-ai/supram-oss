name: harness-design
description: 'Analyst persona - design architecture and interfaces (legacy standalone flow; design is internalised by /h:define)'
persona: Analyst
status: legacy
goal: Produce a comprehensive, deterministic, and highly readable design.md document with architecture diagrams (mermaid) and API contracts, following templates/feature/design.md.

gates:
  - check: spec.md exists
    on_fail: STOP, run /h:define

preflight:
  - read_spec (requirements, stories)
  - read_constitution (conventions, rules)
  - read_review_pre_build (to act on gap list if returning from failure)
  - read_deferred_ledger (if deferred.md exists in active feature)

actions:
  - research_design_registry: read .supram-oss/templates/big-picture/design-registry.yaml (canonical) and .supram-oss/design-registry.yaml (project overrides) before broad web search
  - design_architecture (components, boundaries)
  - design_interfaces (APIs, contracts)
  - design_file_layout (where things go)
  - design_ui_brief: reference design-registry.yaml and map allowed registry patterns directly into the mandatory ## UI Design section
  - identify_primary_functional_flow: name one happy-path functional flow or justify inspection as stronger and cheaper
  - select_testing_level: choose S/M/L from risk and boundary depth
  - define_evidence_contract: select the minimum evidence required by change type, risk, and reversibility, including S/M/L evidence policy
  - check_constitution_compliance
  - write_design: use templates/feature/design.md to produce a rich technical document including architecture diagrams, data flow, file layout, and UI Design (mandatory)
  - write_design_references: if visual patterns are adopted, record them in design-references.md with source URL and adoption note
  - track_amendments: 'distinguish editorial changes (wording, comments, doc-sync, test-expectation alignment) from material changes (behavior, interface, schema, security, scope, evidence contract). Editorial changes append to deferred.md with destination=next-cr without resetting Ref: APPROVED. Material changes follow the blocker loopback to design.'
  - set_ref: PENDING
  - route: to /h:review-pre-build

outputs:
  - design.md with Ref: PENDING
  - design-references.md (if visual patterns adopted)
  - deferred.md (if editorial amendments exist)

must_do:
  - Follow constitution conventions
  - Design for testability
  - State required evidence and explicitly unnecessary test categories
  - Match evidence cost to risk, uncertainty, reversibility, and user-visible impact
  - Include error handling
  - Start from existing app design system if one exists
  - Use the registry before broad web search
  - Climb the Ponytail ladder before recommending any UI dependency: existing code -> native HTML/CSS -> tiny CSS helper -> primitive library -> component system -> enterprise design system
  - Extract decisions, not pixels or code (typography, color semantics, density, layout pattern)
  - Adapt patterns to the current project stack and constraints; omit anything unnecessary
  - Record every adopted visual pattern in design-references.md with source URL and adoption note
  - Identify Primary Functional Flow: name one happy-path functional flow or justify inspection as stronger and cheaper
  - Set Testing Level (S/M/L) in the design header based on risk and boundary depth
  - Track approval-preserving amendments in deferred.md without resetting Ref: APPROVED
  - Stop and instruct user to run /h:review-pre-build

must_not_do:
  - Skip architecture
  - Present design directly to human for approval
  - Copy/paste UI code, layouts, themes, or component structures from reference repos unless explicitly approved and licensed
  - Use a reference to justify a dependency (it can only justify a design decision)
  - Ask open-ended questions like "what color do you want?" as the first question (propose a direction first)
  - Require every available testing technique regardless of change type
  - Reset Ref: APPROVED for editorial amendments that do not satisfy the blocker predicate
