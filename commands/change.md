description: Unified change workflow command for bugs and CRs.
persona: Developer
gates:
  - check: spec.yaml exists (to read workflow level and constraints)
    on_fail: STOP, run /h:define first

actions:
  - classify_change: identify if the change is a bug or CR
  - evaluate_promotion_criteria: promote to full /h:define if the change touches a locked stack, public interface, persistent schema, security boundary, or architecture boundary
  - record_baseline: capture baseline revision hash, dirty state, and observed/reproduction behavior
  - record_worktree_ownership: populate worktree.yaml using templates/worktree.yaml classifying files to touch as authorized, untracked as generated, and others as preexisting
  - read_prior_decisions: read decisions from the active spec.yaml and past slices
  - write_change_record: create CHG-NNN.yaml (or CHG-NNN.md) using templates/feature/change.md carrying forward baseline, delta, decisions, and relevant prior decisions
  - implement_smallest_delta: implement the change using the smallest required code delta
  - run_focused_evidence: verify the change on the affected flow and boundary only
  - commit: commit the change record, worktree record, and implementation code
  - route: to /h:verify

must_do:
  - Promote change to full define flow if promotion criteria are met
  - Capture dirty worktree state in CHG-NNN baseline section BEFORE making edits
  - Create and populate worktree.yaml before making any code modifications
  - Carry forward relevant decisions from prior slices
  - Use the smallest code delta to resolve the bug or CR
  - Run focused evidence on the affected boundary
  - Regenerate the derived handover snapshot (Supram runtime)

must_not_do:
  - Implement change touching locked stack or schema without promoting to full define flow
  - Commit implementation code without passing the focused evidence check
