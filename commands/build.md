description: Implement features using the approved evidence contract
persona: Developer
gates:
  - check: 'spec.yaml "Ref: APPROVED" (if workflow_level != S; ABSENT defaults to M/L)'
    on_fail: STOP, route to /h:approve (Human Gate 1)
  - check: no BLOCKED.md in active features
    on_fail: STOP, route to blocked-state recovery (Supram runtime)

preflight:
  - read_spec (requirements, design, and tasks; if workflow_level != S)
  - read_review_pre_verify (to fix code defects if returning from failure)
  - read_deferred_ledger (if deferred.md exists in active feature)

actions:
  - for_each_task (if workflow_level != S, else implement spec requirements directly):
    - execute_ponytail_decision_ladder: evaluate before adding any dependencies or abstractions
    - produce_required_evidence: follow the approved evidence contract
    - use_tdd_for_executable_logic: confirm failure before implementation when a meaningful executable test exists (for deterministic invariants not provable by functional flow)
    - commit
  - resolve_deferred_items: iterate current-build deferred items, resolve each or reroute with explicit destination update to pre-verify or next-cr
  - update_ledger_status: mark resolved items with resolution evidence in deferred.md
  - after_all_tasks:
    - run_required_evidence
    - run_existing_regression_suite
    - if evidence_fails: STOP, fix evidence failures
    - if evidence_passes: route to /h:review-pre-verify if workflow_level == L, else to /h:verify

must_do:
  - Strictly follow the Ponytail YAGNI framework when writing code
  - Use the cheapest deterministic evidence that proves the task
  - Use regression-first testing for bug fixes
  - Use TDD only for deterministic invariants not provable by the functional flow
  - Record why a required evidence item is not applicable
  - Commit after each task
  - Resolve or explicitly reroute assigned current-build deferred items
  - Update ledger status with resolution evidence
  - Regenerate the derived handover snapshot after build completes or fails (Supram runtime)

must_not_do:
  - Implement executable logic without its required evidence
  - Add test categories excluded by the approved evidence contract without a discovered design gap
  - Commit without passing required evidence
  - Silently drop deferred items
