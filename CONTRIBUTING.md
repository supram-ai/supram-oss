# Contributing to Supram OSS

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This project is the open-source
core of **Supram** — a control plane for AI-driven software development.

By contributing you agree to the terms below. Please read this document
fully before opening your first pull request.

## 1. Licensing — AGPL-3.0 + Contributor License Agreement

This repository is licensed under the **GNU Affero General Public License,
version 3** (see [`LICENSE`](./LICENSE)). Supram Code Tech Pvt Ltd.
dual-licenses the core
commercially, so in order to accept contributions we require a **Contributor
License Agreement (CLA)**.

### The Contributor License Agreement

By submitting a contribution (code, documentation, tests, or any other
material), you agree to grant **Supram Code Tech Pvt Ltd.** and its
successors a **perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free,
irrevocable license** to
use, copy, modify, publish, distribute, sublicense, and create derivative
works from your contribution — including the right to license your
contribution under terms other than the AGPL (for example, within
proprietary commercial products) — **without additional compensation and
without seeking further permission from you.**

You represent that:

- You are legally entitled to grant the above license (you own the work, or
  you have the authority to contribute it on behalf of its owner); and
- Your contribution is your original work and does not infringe the rights
  of any third party.

### How to sign

1. Add a line to **every commit message**:
   ```
   Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>
   ```
2. On your first pull request, comment with:
   ```
   I agree to the Supram OSS Contributor License Agreement.
   ```

The `Signed-off-by` line certifies the **Developer Certificate of Origin
(DCO)** — that you have the right to submit the contribution under the
project's license and CLA. Together, the DCO + CLA let us incorporate
community contributions into both the AGPL core and our commercial products.

## 2. Code of Conduct

Be respectful and constructive. Harassment, discrimination, or abusive
behavior of any kind will not be tolerated. By participating you agree to
maintain a professional and inclusive environment for everyone.

## 3. Getting Started

2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feat/your-change`.
3. Make your changes and commit them (with the `Signed-off-by` line above).
4. Push and open a pull request against `main`.

## 4. Development Conventions

- **Workflow scope:** this repo implements the file-based harness workflow
  (`/h:build`, `/h:verify`, S/M/L levels, narrative log, git conventions).
  Features that belong to the commercial Supram tiers (Graph, Vec, Switch,
  Cockpit, Chat, Gateway) are intentionally **not** in this repository.
- **Keep it file-based:** the open-source core is designed to work with any
  agent via plain files. Avoid adding dependencies on a specific agent,
  runtime, or vendor.
- **Tests:** add or update tests for any code change and run the existing
  suite before submitting.

---

## 5. Reporting Issues

- Search existing issues first to avoid duplicates.
- Provide a clear title, steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual behavior,
  and the environment/version you used.

---

## 6. Security

Please do **not** file a public issue for security vulnerabilities. Report
them privately to `info@supram.ai` so we can address them before
disclosure.

## 7. Questions

Open a discussion, or reach out to the maintainers. Thank you for helping
make Supram OSS better!
