## Reference Use Log

For each reference system consulted:

| Reference | Pattern Extracted | What Applies | What Is Omitted | Minimum Local Implementation |
|-----------|------------------|--------------|-----------------|------------------------------|
|           |                  |              |                 |                              |

**Rule**: A reference can justify a design decision, not a dependency. Adding a UI dependency requires independent justification (stdlib-first principle). Reference → extract pattern → adapt to current stack → implement minimally.
