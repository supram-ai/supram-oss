# Spec Template: [FEATURE_NAME]

**Feature**: [FEATURE_NAME]
**Created**: [DATE]
**Status**: Draft
**Ref**: [APPROVED|PENDING]
**Workflow Level**: [S|M|L] (S skips design/tasks/review gates; M/L applies full gate chain; ABSENT defaults to M/L)
**Testing Level**: [S|M|L]

**Input**: [DESCRIPTION_OF_FEATURE]

**Constraints**:
  locked:
    - [Name stack, library, model, strategy, data source, cost model, execution mode, or persistence. Agent must implement or STOP — never silently substitute]

**State Classification**:
  - class: model
    write_policy: auto-update allowed when marked virtual/replayable
  - class: operational
    write_policy: tool may update within documented boundary
  - class: curated_project
    write_policy: requires normal build/change authority + focused evidence
  - class: external_authoritative
    write_policy: requires explicit user approval at moment of action

## Behavior Model

> Complete this section when the change introduces material or uncertain user-visible behavior, state transitions, or failure handling. Otherwise write `N/A` with a reason.

### Actors and Goals
- [Who initiates the behavior and what outcome they need]

### Initial Conditions
- [Facts that must already be true]

### Primary Event Flow
- [Command -> domain event -> policy/reaction -> resulting state]

### Alternative and Failure Flows
- [Validation failure, rejection, timeout, retry, cancellation, recovery]

### State Transitions
- [Current state, event, guard, resulting state, side effect, visible result]

### Invariants
- [Conditions that must always or never be true]

### Provenance
- [Mark statements as: Confirmed, Observed, Inferred, or Assumed]

---

## User Stories

### Story 1 — [STORY_TITLE] (Priority: P1)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Value and reasoning]
**Independent test**: [How to verify this story alone]

**Acceptance Criteria**:

1. [Observable, independently verifiable outcome]
2. [Use Given/When/Then when state and event sequencing matter]

---

### Story 2 — [STORY_TITLE] (Priority: P2)

[Describe this user journey]

**Why this priority**: [Value]
**Independent test**: [How to verify]

**Acceptance Criteria**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

[Add more stories as needed]

---

## Edge Cases

- What happens when [boundary condition]?
- How does system handle [error scenario]?

---

## Functional Evidence

> Define the primary functional flow and evidence expectations by testing level. This connects spec acceptance criteria to the design's evidence contract.

**Primary functional flow**: [One happy-path flow that proves the feature works, or justification that inspection is stronger and cheaper]

**Evidence expectations by level**:
- **Level S**: One happy-path functional check or cheapest deterministic inspection. No unit-test quota.
- **Level M**: Happy path + important failure path + every affected material boundary. Integration across affected boundaries.
- **Level L**: Full E2E functional flow, critical failure/recovery, regression, operational sanity.

**Level selected**: [S|M|L] — [reason from risk and boundary depth]

---

## Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST [specific capability]
- **FR-002**: System MUST [specific capability]
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to [key interaction]

*Mark unclear requirements:*
- **FR-004**: System MUST [capability] [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: <what's unclear>]

## Success Criteria

| # | Criterion | Measurable? |
|---|-----------|-------------|
| SC-001 | [metric, e.g., "Users complete checkout in under 3 minutes"] | ✅ |
| SC-002 | [metric] | ✅ |

---

## Key Entities

- **[ENTITY_1]**: [What it represents, key attributes]
- **[ENTITY_2]**: [What it represents, relationships]

---

## Technical Decisions

| ID | Decision | Rationale | Assumptions |
|---|---|---|---|
| DEC-001 | [Decision] | [Rationale/Alternatives] | [Assumptions] |

---

## Assumptions

- [Assumption about users, environment, dependencies]
- [Assumption about scope boundaries]

---

## Out of Scope

- [What this feature explicitly does NOT solve]

---
