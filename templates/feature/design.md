# Design Template: [FEATURE_NAME]

**Branch**: `[BRANCH_NAME]`
**Date**: [DATE]
**Spec**: [link to spec.md]
**Ref**: [APPROVED|PENDING|REJECTED]
**Approved by**: [Human|Agent]
**Approved date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Workflow Level**: [S|M|L] (S skips design/tasks/review gates; M/L applies full gate chain; ABSENT defaults to M/L)
**Testing Level**: [S|M|L]

**Input**: Feature specification from `specs/[FEATURE]/spec.md`

---

## Summary

[Extract from spec: primary requirement + technical approach]

---

## Primary Functional Flow

> Name the single happy-path functional flow that proves the feature works. If inspection (static analysis, manual review, documentation verification) is stronger and cheaper than functional testing, justify that choice explicitly.

**Primary flow**: [Describe the one happy-path functional flow, e.g., "User submits form -> backend validates -> database persists -> confirmation displayed"]

**Justification (if inspection)**: [Only if no functional flow: explain why inspection provides stronger evidence at lower cost]

---

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: [LANGUAGE_VERSION] or NEEDS CLARIFICATION

**Primary Dependencies**: [DEPENDENCIES] or NEEDS CLARIFICATION

**Storage**: [STORAGE] or N/A

**Testing**: [TEST_FRAMEWORK] or NEEDS CLARIFICATION

**Target Platform**: [PLATFORM] or NEEDS CLARIFICATION

**Performance Goals**: [GOALS] or NEEDS CLARIFICATION

---

## Constitution Check

> *GATE: Must pass before implementation. Re-check after design.*

| Rule | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| [PRINCIPLE_1_NAME] | ✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL | [if fail, explain] |
| [PRINCIPLE_2_NAME] | ✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL | [if fail, explain] |
| [PRINCIPLE_3_NAME] | ✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL | [if fail, explain] |

**If any gate FAILS:** Document in Complexity Tracking section below.

## Architecture

### Component Map

```
<visual representation of components>
```

| Component | Responsibility | Depends On |
|-----------|---------------|------------|
| [COMPONENT] | [WHAT IT DOES] | [DEPENDENCIES] |

### Data Flow

[How data moves through the system]

### Interfaces

```[LANGUAGE]
// Function signatures, API endpoints, type definitions
[INTERFACE_DEFINITIONS]
```

---

## File Layout

**New Files:**
- [PATH] — [purpose]

**Modified Files:**
- [PATH] — [what changes]

---

## UI Design

[Describe UI architecture, components, and layout mapping from registry]

---

## Evidence Contract

**Change classification**: [documentation / configuration / pure logic / stateful behavior / integration boundary / UI / security-sensitive]
**Risk and reversibility**: [LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH] — [reason]

### S/M/L Evidence Matrix

| Level | Primary evidence | Integration depth | Failure/recovery evidence |
|-------|-----------------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| Level S | One happy-path functional check, or cheapest deterministic inspection | None (unit or below) | None required |
| Level M | Happy path + important failure path + every affected material boundary | Integration across affected boundaries | Failure at each boundary |
| Level L | Full E2E functional flow | End-to-end across all critical paths | Critical failure/recovery, regression, operational sanity |

**Selected level**: [S|M|L] — [reason from risk and boundary depth]

### Evidence Table

| Requirement or Risk | Required Evidence | Evidence Level | Why Sufficient |
|---------------------|-------------------|----------------|----------------|
| [behavior/risk] | [inspection, static check, unit test, integration test, browser check, scenario, other] | [level] | [reason] |

**Explicitly not required:**
- [Test or technique that adds no decision value for this change, with reason]

### Universal Policy

- Test count and coverage are not gate criteria. Evidence is evaluated by decision value, not quantity.
- Placeholder, self-fulfilling, or duplicate tests are not evidence.
- When a reviewer names extra evidence beyond the contract, they must cite concrete risk.

**Completion rule:** All required evidence passes and the existing regression suite has no failures. Testing techniques not listed above are not release requirements unless implementation exposes a security risk, scope change, or false design assumption.

## Research & Technical Decisions

> *Technical decisions with rationale.*

| ID | Decision | Rationale | Alternatives Rejected | Assumptions |
|----|----------|-----------|----------------------|-------------|
| DEC-001 | [DECISION] | [WHY] | [WHAT ELSE AND WHY NOT] | [ASSUMPTIONS] |

---

## Complexity Tracking

> *Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified.*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [VIOLATION] | [NEED] | [WHY SIMPLER NOT ENOUGH] |

---

## Design Confidence

| Claim | Confidence | Source |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| [CLAIM] | VERIFIED / INFERRED / ASSUMED | [SOURCE] |

**Review priority:** ASSUMED needs confirmation. INFERRED needs validation. VERIFIED needs sanity check.

---

## Self-Challenge

> *Before human review, argue against your own design.*

**What is the strongest reason this design might be wrong?**
[HONEST_ASSESSMENT]

**What assumption am I making that I haven't stated?**
[UNSTATED_ASSUMPTION]

**What would need to be true for this to fail?**
[FAILURE_CONDITIONS]
