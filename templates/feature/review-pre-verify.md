# Sr Tech Lead Review: <feature>

**Date**: <date>
**Feature**: <feature name>
**Reviewer**: Automated (Sr Tech Lead prompt)
**Ref**: PENDING
**Status**: PASS / FAIL / CONDITIONAL

## Skill Evidence

| Technology area | Installed skill | Status | Framework capability checks |
|-----------------|-----------------|--------|-----------------------------|
| <scope> | <skill path> | CONSULTED / MISSING | <checks> |

**Missing relevant skills**: <None or list>
**Duplicated framework capabilities**: <None or findings>

## Story Coverage

| Story | Implemented | Required Evidence | Design Match | Quality | Status |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|--------------|---------|--------|
| US1 | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ | PASS/FAIL |
| US2 | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ | ✅/❌ | PASS/FAIL |

## Gap Analysis

| # | Story | Gap | Category | Severity | Fix |
|---|-------|-----|----------|----------|-----|
| 1 | <story> | <description> | Feature/Test/Code | CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM | <fix> |

## Evidence Contract Compliance

| Required Evidence | Result | Reproducible Evidence | Status |
|-------------------|--------|-----------------------|--------|
| <approved evidence> | <result> | <command/artifact> | PASS/FAIL |

Classify every finding as `DEFECT`, `DESIGN_GAP`, or `IMPROVEMENT`. Only defects and design gaps block verification. Do not expand the approved Evidence Contract unless implementation exposes a security risk, scope change, or false design assumption.

## Quality Findings

| # | File | Issue | Severity | Fix |
|---|------|-------|----------|-----|
| 1 | <file:line> | <description> | HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW | <fix> |

## Constitution Violations

| # | Rule | Violation | Justified? | Fix |
|---|------|-----------|------------|-----|
| 1 | <rule> | <description> | Yes/No | <fix> |

## Summary

- CRITICAL gaps: N
- HIGH gaps: N
- MEDIUM gaps: N
- Stories passing: N/M
- Evidence Contract coverage: N/M required checks

## Verdict

- **PASS**: All stories implemented, required evidence passes, and quality is acceptable → proceed to verify
- **CONDITIONAL**: High gaps found → back to build for fixes
- **FAIL**: Critical gaps found → back to build for fixes

## Handover (if FAIL or CONDITIONAL)
