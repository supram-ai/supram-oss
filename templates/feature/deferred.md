# Deferred Ledger: [FEATURE_NAME]

**Feature**: [FEATURE_NAME]
**Created**: [DATE]

---

## Deferred Findings

| ID | Source | Finding | Rationale | Destination | Status | Resolution Evidence |
|----|--------|---------|-----------|-------------|--------|---------------------|
| D-001 | [command] | [description] | [why deferred] | [destination] | [status] | [evidence or empty] |

---

## Destination Definitions

- **current-build**: Include in the current build as a `[DEFERRED]` task without expanding approved scope.
- **pre-verify**: Reconcile during review-pre-verify. Check whether the finding was addressed during build.
- **next-cr**: Address in the next change request or feature cycle.
- **backlog**: Parked indefinitely. No commitment to address.

## Status Definitions

- **open**: Finding is recorded and awaiting resolution at the designated destination.
- **resolved**: Finding has been addressed. Resolution evidence must be populated.
- **superseded**: Finding was overtaken by a later design decision or code change.
- **promoted-to-blocker**: Finding was re-evaluated and now satisfies the blocker predicate. Routes backward to the earliest affected command.

## Archival Instructions

When the feature is released (moved to `specs/done/` or `phases/archive/`), the deferred.md file is archived with the feature. Unresolved items carry forward as historical record. Items with status `promoted-to-blocker` must have been routed back before release.
