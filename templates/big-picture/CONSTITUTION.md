## Project Purpose

> *What are we building and why? This grounds every decision.*

[ONE_SENTENCE_SUMMARY]

**Full requirements:** See `BRD.md`
**Domain context:** See `domain-ctx.txt` (if created)

---

## SST Golden Rules

> *Universal rules for every document. Hardcoded — do not modify.*

**Simple:** One concept per file. Every instruction is a single action verb. No conditional language.
**Clear:** Every step produces the same output regardless of LLM. No ambiguous terms. Every file path is explicit.
**Direct:** Tell the agent what TO DO, not what NOT to do. Gates use STOP with condition.
**Single Source of Truth:** Every rule exists in exactly one file. Agent definitions live in `agents/<name>/agent.md`.
**Testable:** Every document has a verification path. If you can't test it, remove the step.
**Trustworthy:** Never guess. Check file paths before referencing. After 3 failed attempts, STOP and escalate.

## Core Principles

### Protocol Principles (Universal — Do Not Modify)

#### I. Proportionate Evidence
Define the minimum convincing evidence for each change before implementation. Use TDD for executable logic when a meaningful automated test exists. Do not require BDD, unit, integration, UI, or mutation testing by default; require only evidence justified by behavior, risk, and reversibility.

#### II. Std Lib First
Use standard library before adding dependencies. Justify every dependency addition.

#### III. Verify Before Assuming
Never assume a framework, library, or API feature exists without verifying. Check source, check docs, write a probe if uncertain.

#### IV. Files Are the Instructions
The protocol works because the files are the instructions. The folder structure is the state machine.

#### V. Human in Control
The user owns the what and the why. The agent owns the how — within boundaries the user approved. Never self-approve.

### Project Principles (Must Be Filled — Project-Specific)

> *These principles are specific to THIS project. They define how the code should be structured, what patterns to use, and what constraints apply. Examples: "Game logic must be pure functions", "State transitions must be explicit", "UI layer must be separate from business logic".*

<!-- MUST INPUT: Add 2-5 project-specific principles -->

## Mandatory Gates

> *Three checkpoints that enforce quality. Never skip any gate unless workflow level policy permits.*

```yaml
gates:
  - name: "Design approval"
    type: human
    command: "/h:approve"
    blocks: "tasks, build"
    description: "Human reviews architecture before implementation (only for M/L-level projects; skipped for S-level)"

  - name: "Sr Tech Lead review"
    type: agent
    command: "/h:review-pre-verify"
    blocks: "verify"
    description: "Agent compares design vs code, catches gaps (only for M/L-level projects; skipped for S-level)"

  - name: "Release approval"
    type: human
    command: "/h:release"
    blocks: "merge"
    description: "Human approves final release"

must_not_do:
  - Skip any gate
  - Self-approve (agent cannot approve its own work)
  - Release without all gates passing
```

## Release Policy

> *Project-specific transport policy. Human Gate 2 is mandatory for every strategy.*

```yaml
release_policy:
  strategy: "local_merge" # Options: local_merge | pull_request | direct
  target_branch: "main"
  require_human_approval: true
  push_branch: true
  push_tag: true
```

- `local_merge`: after explicit release approval, merge into the target branch locally, then push the target branch and release tag.
- `pull_request`: create a PR, wait for the human to merge it remotely, synchronize the target branch, then push the release tag.
- `direct`: for solo devs, assuming work is done directly on the target branch. Just push the target branch and release tag.

---

## Logical Roles and Agent Mappings

> Legacy contracts (`/h:design`, `/h:tasks`, `/h:review-pre-build`, `/h:approve`) are listed
> for reference. The current model internalises design and tasks into `/h:define`; the agent
> gate is `/h:review-pre-verify`.

| Logical Role | Commands Managed | File-Based Agent Definition | Responsibility & Context |
|--------------|------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Manager** | `/h:init`, `/h:upgrade-harness`, `/h:status` | *None (Parent Context)* | Orchestrates the workflow execution, manages the subagent invocation loop, and checks status/quality gates. Run directly in the main/parent shell. |
| **Analyst** | `/h:define`, `/h:design` | `agents/collaborator/agent.md` | Explores problem space, drafts feature specifications (`spec.yaml`), and architects designs. |
| **Sr Architect** | `/h:review-pre-build` | `agents/sr-architect/agent.md` | Audits proposed design documents against the BRD and project constitution before the design is presented for human approval. |
| **Developer** | `/h:tasks`, `/h:build` | `agents/developer/agent.md` | Breaks the approved design into tasks and implements against its approved Evidence Contract. |
| **Sr Tech Lead** | `/h:review-pre-verify` | `agents/sr-tech-lead/agent.md` | Audits implementation code against the approved design and spec, verifying alignment and syntax conformance. |
| **Gatekeeper** | `/h:verify`, `/h:release`, `/h:approve` | `agents/gatekeeper/agent.md` | Validates gate prerequisites, runs testing validation, and handles human decisions (transmitting explicit human approvals for design and release). |

---

## Architecture Rules (Project-Specific)

> *These rules define how the code should be structured for THIS project. They are NOT about the protocol. Examples: "Separate game logic from UI", "Use immutable state", "All API calls must go through a service layer", "Database queries must use parameterized statements".*

<!-- MUST INPUT: Add 3-5 project-specific architecture rules -->

- [PROJECT_RULE_1]
- [PROJECT_RULE_2]
- [PROJECT_RULE_3]

---

## Naming Conventions (Project-Specific)

> *These are naming conventions for THIS project's code, NOT for protocol commands or branches. Examples: function names, file names, component names, variable names.*

<!-- MUST INPUT: Add project-specific naming conventions -->

| Element | Convention | Example |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| Files | [PROJECT_FILE_CONVENTION] | [PROJECT_FILE_EXAMPLE] |
| Functions | [PROJECT_FUNCTION_CONVENTION] | [PROJECT_FUNCTION_EXAMPLE] |
| Variables | [PROJECT_VARIABLE_CONVENTION] | [PROJECT_VARIABLE_EXAMPLE] |
| Classes/Types | [PROJECT_CLASS_CONVENTION] | [PROJECT_CLASS_EXAMPLE] |

---

## Explicitly Rejected

> *Things tried or considered and ruled out. The agent uses this to avoid re-suggesting rejected approaches.*

- **[APPROACH]**: rejected because [REASON]
- **[APPROACH]**: rejected because [REASON]

---

## Quality Standards

> *Universal quality standards that apply to all code, regardless of language.*

### Evidence
- **Evidence is change-specific** — select checks based on behavior, risk, and reversibility
- **Prefer the cheapest deterministic check** — inspection, static validation, unit, integration, browser, and scenario checks are options, not a mandatory stack
- **Exercise failure paths when failure behavior is material** — do not manufacture irrelevant test categories

### Server Hygiene
- **Graceful shutdown mandatory** — catch SIGINT/SIGTERM, drain in-flight requests, close connections
- **Health endpoints mandatory** — `/healthz` for liveness, `/readyz` for readiness
- **No orphaned goroutines** — every goroutine must have a cancellation path and wait mechanism

### Code Quality
- **No global mutable state** — inject all dependencies via constructors
- **Errors must carry context** — never `return err` without wrapping
- **Configuration from standard locations** — `~/.config/<app>/` for secrets, env vars for non-secrets

## AI Agent Rules

> *What the agent must NEVER do, regardless of user instruction.*

```yaml
session_start:
  - Read AGENTS.md before any action (contains workflow rules, commands, gates)
  - Read .supram-oss/CONSTITUTION.md before any action
  - Store rules in memory if agent supports it

must_do:
  - Read technology.yaml before running test, lint, or build commands
  - Read active language skills before writing code
  - Triage requests (bug/CR/feature/deferred) before implementing
  - Run every check in the approved Evidence Contract before claiming "done"
  - Run tests before AND after refactoring
  - Test core functionality under actual runtime conditions (button clicks, API responses, stream chunks)
  - After 3 failed fix attempts: write BLOCKED and escalate to human

must_not_do:
  - Violate any rule in this CONSTITUTION
  - Change CONSTITUTION without explicit human instruction
  - Start implementing before design is approved
  - Claim "done" without satisfying the approved Evidence Contract
  - Assume feature works just because it compiles without errors
  - Skip regression tests for bug fixes
```
