description: Big-picture template for the system architecture document.

gates:
  - check: BRD.md exists
    on_fail: STOP, Cannot design architecture without requirements

actions:
  - Fill system overview, layers, data flow, deployment, and technology sections

outputs:
  - .supram-oss/ARCHITECTURE.md

must_do:
  - Align architecture layers with BRD requirements

must_not_do:
  - Leave system boundary undefined

## System Overview
<1-2 sentences: what the system does and how it's structured>

---

## Component Map

```
<visual representation of components and their relationships>
```

| Component | Responsibility | Depends On |
|-----------|---------------|------------|
| <component> | <what it does> | <what it needs> |

---

## Layer Model

| Layer | Purpose | Contains |
|-------|---------|----------|
| <layer> | <purpose> | <what lives here> |

---

## Data Flow

<How data moves through the system>
<API boundaries, message queues, databases>

---

## External Dependencies

| Service | Purpose | Fallback |
|---------|---------|----------|
| <service> | <what it provides> | <what happens if it fails> |

---

## Deployment

- Platform: <Linux / Docker / K8s / Serverless>
- Build: <command from technology.yaml>
- Binary: <output path>

## Non-Functional Requirements

| Requirement | Target |
|-------------|--------|
| Performance | <latency, throughput targets> |
| Scalability | <concurrent users, data volume> |
| Availability | <uptime target> |
