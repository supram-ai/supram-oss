## Validation Checklist

> *Run this checklist before finalizing the BRD.*

**Completeness:**
- [ ] Executive summary is 2-3 sentences (not a paragraph)
- [ ] All stakeholders identified with clear interests
- [ ] Problems are specific (not vague like "improve efficiency")
- [ ] Success metrics are measurable (numbers, not adjectives)
- [ ] Constraints are explicit (timeline, budget, regulatory)
- [ ] Out of scope is listed (prevents scope creep)

**Quality:**
- [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, tools)
- [ ] Written for business stakeholders, not developers
- [ ] Every problem maps to at least one success metric
- [ ] Every constraint has a clear implication

**Traceability:**
- [ ] Problems trace to stakeholder needs
- [ ] Success metrics trace to problems
- [ ] Constraints trace to business reality
